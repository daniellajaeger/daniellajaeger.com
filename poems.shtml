				<p>MANGO STREET PARADE</p>
				<p>Here were palm trees for Christmas<br>
					Sugar sand and a melting sun<br>
					A mango street parade<br>
					First mirage slivers, then a loud wave<br>
					It swallowed you whole<br>
					With the rest of San Juan.</p>

				<p>It was all makeshift<br>
					Fake beards and hand-me-down music<br>
					Girls with sheets for dresses<br>
					Stomping shaking colliding<br>
					Excitement had a monopoly on them all.</p>

				<p>Goodbye elegance, hello colored lights<br>
					Caffeine vibrations and rum nights<br>
					They threw mangoes on the street<br>
					And candies in your hair<br>
					Melting in the heat, into<br>
					Heavy saccharine air.</p>

				<p>Everyone a dancing candy<br>
					Wrapped, unwrapped, on<br>
					Cellophane streets<br>
					Sticky skin and sweat like<br>
					Syrup, dripping from<br>
					Body to body, from<br>
					Chin to chest, from<br>
					Sole to concrete.</p>

				<p>A tropical soup<br>
					Of boiling dancing things<br>
					It caught you and<br>
					You danced, too<br>
					In wild shakes and feverish spins<br>
					Fighting hot wind<br>
					Fighting gravity<br>
					Fighting the memory of reality.</p>

				<p>It was just a mango street party<br>
					And you, a mango too<br>
					But only briefly<br>
					Until you ripened and fell<br>
					To the sideline, no longer weightless<br>
					A broken spell.</p>

				<p>You sat in wrapper heaps<br>
					Sweat now a quiet dew<br>
					Watching the parade<br>
					Parade on by, to<br>
					Other burning streets<br>
					Far away from you.</p>

				<p>SUNDAY NIGHT GAME</p>
				<p>It was one of those nights<br>
					When the weather's mood<br>
					Matched mine.</p>

				<p>There were leaves on the ground.<br>
					I wanted to pick up leaves like words.<br>
					I wanted to pick up words like leaves.<br>
					And petals off my nose.</p>

				<p>It was a strange day,<br>
					The day the amateur found romance<br>
					In his fingers.</p>

				<p>The headphones played jazz.<br>
					Take me to<br>
					The real thing<br>
					And I'll play with you too.</p>

				<p>And then<br>
					Hey, lady! Come inside!<br>
					Live jazz, no cover!<br>
					The famous Butch Warren<br>
					On the bass tonight<br>
					For you.</p>

				<p>Butch ate stale soup<br>
					Outside<br>
					On a cold iron chair<br>
					Waiting his turn.</p>

				<p>He gave me a grunt<br>
					Stale like his soup<br>
					And I said<br>
					Nice to meet you<br>
					Famous jazz man.</p>

				<p>And I wanted to say<br>
					You play your game<br>
					I play mine.<br>
					Okay?</p>

				<p>And he said<br>
					You can't just spew<br>
					Up onto a page.<br>
					Not without at least<br>
					A little stir.</p>

				<p>So I said<br>
					Let me try<br>
					This writing thing.<br>
					And bring me one<br>
					Martini.</p>

				<p>Plus one lime,<br>
					Minus one cherry.</p>

				<p>I wanted snow on the leaves and<br>
					snow on the words,<br>
					In my hair and on my clothes.<br>
					I wanted a nice pen.</p>

				<p>The trumpet player sat at the bar<br>
					Pretending to play guitar.<br>
					Why does he lie?</p>

				<p>Hey! No more jazz, trumpet player?<br>
					Hey! Don't leave me to<br>
					Play all alone.</p>

				<p>There were three roses in the window<br>
					And stained glass in frames.<br>
					And the poem would be<br>
					A sad pile of leaves.</p>

				<p>Dip out, now<br>
					Run away!<br>
					Leave the playing to the<br>
					Masters<br>
					Lady.</p>

				<p>One martini<br>
					With water on the side?<br>
					Please!<br>
					And mix me a<br>
					Pile of leaves.</p>

				<p>The glass made<br>
					A four-ring shadow on<br>
					My polyester tablecloth.<br>
					Dance with<br>
					Me, shadow!</p>

				<p>Oh, the sad dialogue<br>
					Of romantic fingers.<br>
					Minus money,<br>
					Plus pathetic.</p>

				<p>The trumpet player's a drummer now.<br>
					Delusion virus?<br>
					It was just an experiment!</p>

				<p>Too much money.<br>
					Too many trees.<br>
					Too much thinking.<br>
					It pollutes the leaves.</p>

				<p>It was a bad pen.<br>
					So bye bye jazz.</p>

				<p>Good night in the city.<br>
					Good night to the city.<br>
					Don't be courageous.<br>
					Forget those sad romantic fingers.</p>

				<p>THE CRAZIES</p>
				<p>the crazies<br>
					they wander around<br>
					with big eyes and big hair and big ideas<br>
					making things</p>

				<p>and the others<br>
					they also wander<br>
					happy and healthy and loving and free<br>
					but they make nothing</p>

				<p>so if you want to make things<br>
					you have to be a crazy<br>
					with big eyes and big hair and big ideas<br>
					but you can't be happy<br>
					and you can't be healthy<br>
					and I guess you can't be free</p>

				<p>but you'll be able to make things<br>
					and you'll be special<br>
					and the others will want to be crazy like you</p>

				<p>and everyone will love you<br>
					and in death you will be loved<br>
					in your grave you'll roll in crazy love<br>
					and the dirt will ooze with poetry</p>

				<p>but you're not alive to see it, really<br>
					and you're not alive to taste it<br>
					so while in life you had big eyes and big hair and big ideas<br>
					only in death will you be free</p>

				<p>GUY ON METRO</p>
				<p>On the metro I sat next to a guy in a dark suit and a top hat. He had a black briefcase on his lap that looked like it came out of the early 1900s or something. Out of the corner of my eye I could see that really the whole outfit looked like he'd just walked off the boat at Ellis Island, back in the day when many people walked off boats there. Something smelled strongly of flowers and it came from him I think. The smell was very strong, like he'd just taken a shower in his mother's perfume, or his girlfriend's perfume. He started looking for something in his briefcase, and I was wondering if maybe the whole thing was filled with rose petals. I thought of him opening his bag and the rose petals pouring out of it, onto the seat and my thighs and the floor and my feet. I felt good next to this guy, like I was in a very sweet time warp. Like I was on a ship coming from Eastern Europe at the beginning of the 20th century, but instead of the air smelling like seawater and piss, it smelled like this guy who showered in rose petals.</p>
